# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the `/users/:id` route lacks proper validation and error handling for cases where `req.params.id` is not a valid user ID. This could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet showcases a route handler that retrieves user data based on a provided ID. However, it's missing crucial error handling.  If an invalid or non-existent ID is passed, the application may encounter an error and fail to handle it gracefully.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to validate the user ID before attempting to retrieve user data.  Appropriate error responses should be returned to the client in case of invalid input.
